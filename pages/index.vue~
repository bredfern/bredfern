          <p>I am a fullstack web and webrtc developer and my primary tool at the moment is vuejs and node/express although I have also worked with socket.io, and with other languages, rails, php, flask and django, as well as tensorflow.</p>
	  <p>Currently I'm teaching myself rust, previously I have worked with c/c++ on Linux but I love the rust syntax its easy to dive into when you have been also workig heavily with the es6 version of javascript.</p>
